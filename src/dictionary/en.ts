  Formula Student is an international engineering competition, 
  initiated by the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1979. 
  The aim is to provide students with a practical platform to 
  build and learn. Students develop technical, management, and 
  teamwork skills. Points are awarded in both static and dynamic events, 
  and the team with the most points wins. The competition's popularity has grown, 
  attracting participants from over 20 countries and 600 universities. 
  The BlueStreamline team is striving for a meritorious ranking in the competition.`,

  paragraphBS09 = ` The 2008-2009 season holds deep significance for the BlueStreamline team, as it marks the season when the team was founded, building the first Formula Student race car from Romania to ever participate in an international competition of this kind.`,
  paragraphBS10 = ` The experience of the first season served as a source of inspiration for the team members and a way to broaden their horizons regarding knowledge of this phenomenon. Thus, the new 2010 season was approached with great courage, high expectations, and hopes. Driven by this attitude, the BlueStreamline team built a much more competitive and safer race car, which competed alongside the elite of the world's universities on the famous circuits of Silverstone and Catalunya.`,
  paragraphBS11 = ` The 2011 competitive season brought immense joy to the team. The BS11 race car was praised as one of the most beautiful Formula Student cars on the Silverstone circuit. For the first time in its history, the BlueStreamline team also competed in Italy, on the Varano DeMelegari circuit. The encouraging results achieved there motivated the team for the final race, which took place in Spain on the Catalunya circuit, where they finished the endurance race — the "Queen's Race" — in 4th place.`,
  paragraphBS12 = ` Building on the previous performance, the team's vision evolved, bringing major changes in the design and construction of the race car. The BS12 is one of the most revolutionary concepts developed by the BlueStreamline team to date, being 50 kg lighter than its predecessor, the BS11. With a bold approach, the race car integrates innovative elements and is much easier to handle. Thanks to these major changes, the team was able to improve competitively, performing admirably in the challenges at the Silverstone and Catalunya competitions. The determination of the team members also served as a source of inspiration for other universities in the country and led to the promotion of the phenomenon in numerous national publications.`,
  paragraphBS13 = ` The 2012-2013 season brought a new generation of energetic students with fresh ideas to the BlueStreamline team. During this season, the team managed to optimize the race car both in terms of design and dynamics. The car ranked in the top 3 for the most efficient vehicles, and the BS13 was noted by the Catalan evaluators as "as simple as it is high-performing."`,
  paragraphBS14 = ` The BS14 race car integrated innovative technological elements, manifested in components such as the steering wheel, pedal box, and suspension, all manufactured in the team's workshop. The team spirit and determination yield results, making BlueStreamline a competitive group against representatives from prestigious universities across Europe.`,
  paragraphBS15 = ` For the seventh consecutive year, BlueStreamline improved both the team's and the race car's performances, achieving for the first time in its history the completion of the Endurance test on the famous Silverstone circuit in England. The passion and dedication of the team reflected the realization of a race car that integrates elements specific to the Streamline style, with a focus on reliability and performance in its design. The competition also brought satisfaction regarding the race car's performance.`,
  paragraphBS16 = ` The key words for the BS16 are simplicity and radicalism in the approach to technical and technological solutions. The team's objectives were to reduce the race car's weight, increase performance and reliability, and consequently achieve higher rankings in the competitions. As a result of sustained effort, the BlueStreamline team successfully met these goals. The hard work and high level of knowledge were reflected in the race car's performance. A significant achievement was made in the acceleration test, where the team ranked at the top, defeating the reigning champion.`,
  paragraphBS17=` The 2016-2017 season marked a fundamental evolution in the construction of the BS17 race car. The innovative approach to the concept led to real progress in the design of the BS17. To increase reliability and improve dynamic behavior, for the first time in the team's history, the race car was equipped with an aerodynamic package consisting of wings and downforce elements, as well as a supercharged engine with a turbocharger. The BS17 was by far the most high-performing race car built by the team to date, and the only deficiency was its reliability, which was improved throughout the competitive season.`,
  paragraphBS18=` The 2017-2018 season represents an important moment in the team's existence. Continuing the progress made in the previous season, our objectives focus on improving the results and reliability of the BS18 race car. The previously built race cars provide us with a valuable framework for developing an advanced concept. The new race car will integrate specific design elements of BlueStreamline, including a more complex aerodynamic package and better integration of the supercharging elements within the powertrain. We greatly hope that this jubilee year will crown our efforts thus far!`,
  paragraphBS19=` The BS19 was a race car built during the 2018-2019 season, representing a significant evolution in design compared to its predecessor. It was used on Formula 1 circuits, such as Silverstone and Circuit de Catalunya. A major innovation in the construction of the BS19 was the use of high-quality composites. Additionally, the race car was fueled with ethanol-based fuel. The project also marked a return to a naturally aspirated engine, which contributed to its performance and maneuverability.`,
  paragraphBS21=` The construction of the BS2021 race car represented an evolution of the BS19 concept, reinterpreting the design concepts and positioning of the powertrain components. Utilizing the knowledge gained, the BlueStreamline team produced a highly reliable race car, which was reflected in the performance achieved. In the 2021 competitive season, the team participated in two international competitions, with the participation in the event in Spain marking a second-place finish in the static Business Plan test. Following their participation in Croatia, the Transylvania University team secured third place (podium) in the dynamic endurance test.`,
  paragraphBS22=` A bold season, in which we welcomed a substantial number of new members to our team, successfully blending and harmonizing the future and development with already known and long-practiced techniques and practices, the 2022 season was daring and revolutionary in terms of innovation, performance, and reliability.  
The team created a race car that stood out for its dynamics and proven performance in the dynamic tests. The BS22 was distinguished by its smooth aerodynamic shapes. A strong point was the improvements made to the engine, which propelled the team toward satisfactory results.`,
